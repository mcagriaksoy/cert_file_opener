# Cert2Tex - An OpenSSL based GUI solution for opening, decompressing, parsing certificates.

Cert File Opener is a simple and easy-to-use app that allows you to open and view certificate files with the .crt, .cer, or .pem extensions. You can also verify the validity and details of the certificates, such as the issuer, the subject, the expiration date, etc.
The program uses OpenSSLâ€™s commands, which is a multi-purpose certificate utility that can be used to display certificate information, convert certificates to various forms, sign certificate requests and so on.

# Features
Open and view certificate files from your local storage or from a URL
Support for different certificate formats, such as DER, PEM, PKCS#7, etc.
Display the certificate information in a user-friendly and readable way
Validate the certificate chain and check for any errors or warnings
Export the certificate to a different format or save it to your device

# How to use

To use Cert File Opener, you need to have a certificate file that you want to open. You can either browse your device for a local file or enter a URL that points to a remote file. Once you select a file, the app will automatically open it and show you the certificate information. You can also switch between different tabs to see more details about the certificate, such as the extensions, the public key, the signature, etc. If you want to export or save the certificate, you can use the buttons at the bottom of the screen.

# How it works

Cert File Opener uses the OpenSSL library to parse and validate the certificate files. OpenSSL is a versatile command line tool that can be used for a large variety of tasks related to Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and HTTPS1. Cert File Opener uses OpenSSL commands to extract and display the certificate information in a convenient way. You can also use OpenSSL commands directly from your terminal if you want to perform more advanced operations on your certificates1.
